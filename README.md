The following repo is a package created in R which contains the implementations of the Linear Regression algorithm from scratch to understand the underlying maths behind it. 


To install the package: 

install_github("Siddhesh19991/Linear-regression-algorithm-") 

 Here's a brief explanation of the Linear Regression algorithm:

• Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target).  <br>
• It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the target variable.  <br>
• The algorithm finds the best-fitting straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the difference between the actual and predicted values of the target variable.  <br>
• This is typically done by minimizing the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values, known as the "least squares" method.  <br>
